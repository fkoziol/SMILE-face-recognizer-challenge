# Step-by-step Faces in the wild dataset computing using VggFace for beginners [STILL IN PROGRESS]
Almost everything contained in the notebook comes from adityajn's kernel on Kaggle.

This notebook aims to offer a step-by-step explanation of the process leading to the succesfull computing of the "Faces in the wild" dataset using VGGFace for beginners. I mainly added annotations and vizualisation steps that don't interfere or improve the overhall quality of the model.

As a junior myself, I had to check the documentation several times and had some tough times understanding the underlying logic of some parts. Don't hesitate to contact me if you spot any misunderstanding as I will immediately correct any error I will know about.
